# `Wombat World One` &mdash; `Geo` Repo

**Wombat World One** is a Minecraft world created for fun/experimental purposes. This repo contains some experimental stuff bridging a fake **Minecraft** world with real **QGIS** geomatics like maps and charts. There's also some automation for Minecraft automation and other stuff, such as an underground-style map made using **LibereOffice Draw**. Just playing around with experimental stuff.

There are tie-ins between the experimental stuff here in this repo, and the (closed-source) [https://github.com/cpknight/Paro](ISR devices I design and build) - I'm using avMinecraft derivative (belief it or not) too assist with analysis algorithm design and testing. The stuff here, though, is open source - so please [LICENCE](feel free to use, reuse, and adapt to your own projects).
