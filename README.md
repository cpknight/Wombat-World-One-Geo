# `Wombat World One` &mdash; `Geo`

**Wombat World One** is a Minecraft world created for fun/experimental purposes. This repo contains some experimental stuff bridging a fake **Minecraft** world with real **QGIS** geomatics like maps and charts. There's also some automation for Minecraft automation and other stuff, such as an underground-style map made using **LibereOffice Draw**. This repo is a just a collection of geomatics and related stuff for some of the QGIS and Minecraft experiments I'm working on at the moment.

There are tie-ins between the experimental stuff here in this repo, and the (closed-source) [ISR devices I design and build](https://github.com/cpknight/Paro) - I'm using (believe it or not) a Minecraft derivative to assist with my analysis/operations algorithm design and testing. The stuff here, though, is open source - so please [feel free to use, reuse, and adapt to your own projects](LICENSE).
