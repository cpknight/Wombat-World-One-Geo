# `Wombat World One &mdash; Geo` Repo

**Wombat World One** is a Minecraft world created for fun/experimental purposes. This repo contains some experimental stuff bridging a fake **Minecraft** world with real **QGIS** geomatics like maps and charts. There's also some automation for Minecraft automation and other stuff, like an underground-style map made using **LibereOffice Draw**. Just playing around with experimental stuff.

There are tie-ins between these experiments and the closed-source ISR devices I design and build (mostly for analysis algorithm design and testing). But this is mostly experimental stuff here, so it's open source - please feel free to use, reuse, and adapt to your own projects.
